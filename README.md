# Distributed Rate Limiter & API Gateway

## Overview
This project implements a distributed rate-limiting system to control API traffic and prevent overload. It demonstrates concurrency-safe design and performance optimization for backend systems.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Redis (for shared state)
- REST APIs

## Features
- Token bucket-based rate limiting
- Concurrency-safe request handling
- Load protection for backend APIs
- Performance logging

## Key Learnings
- Distributed system concepts
- Concurrency handling
- Performance optimization and scalability
